      <p>You're sitting in the living room of your apartment,<br>
      watching your favorite show. Your roommate, Sam is taking his evening nap as usual.<br>
      Your program is cut off and there's an empty alert message on the television screen.<br>
      You hear a lot of commotion outside. You look out the window, people are running around in dismay, and the city is set ablaze!<br>
      <br>You notice that there's a small group traveling together. They're moving pretty fast!<br>
      <br>
      What would you do?
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wake up your roommate! Maybe you can figure out what's going on together.</li>
        <li><!-- Run outside to join the group! They might have a better idea of what's going on. --></li>

In the black water with the sun shining at midnight, those fruit shall come ripe and in the darkness of that which is golden shall split open to reveal the revelation of the fatal softness in the earth. The shadows of the abyss are like the petals of a monstrous flower that shall blossom within the skull and expand the mind beyond what any man can bear, but whether it decays under the earth or above...

And there shall be in the planting in the shadows a grace and a mercy from which shall blossom dark flowers, and their teeth shall devour and sustain and herald the passing of an age. That which dies shall still know life in death for all that decays is not forgotten and reanimated it shall walk the world in the bliss of not-knowing. And then there shall be a fire that knows the naming of you, and in the presence of the strangling fruit, its dark flame shall acquire every part of you that remains.
