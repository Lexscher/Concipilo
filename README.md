# Hi all!

This was one of my projects from unit 1.

I created a text adventure game, Concipilo. English was kinda one of my favorite subjects while I was going to highschool, so I had a lot of fun with this one!

I'll still be adding more to the story - I keep jotting down little notes when inspiration hits.

You can play it [_here_](https://lexscher.github.io/Concipilo/)

Here's what the finished product looks like:

##### Thank you for taking an interest in my code.

### Best,
